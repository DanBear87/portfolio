    "Association Rules were designed to discover relationships in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. Data Scientists were looking for items that were commonly bought together so they could use data to offer customers better deals. For example, the rule: {onions, potatoes} > {burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy burgers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rules have since been used to find relationships between any sequences of things. Examples include things like web analytics (how someone behaves on a website), intrusion detection in cybersecurity (strange series of behaviours might indicate a hack) and bioinformatics in healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "Association Rules are most commonly built using the Aprioriand Eclat algorithms. We're going to be using Apriori for this notebook exercise."

    "We can create a rule that will determine the most frequent itemsets; that is, which collections of items are bought most often. The support of a given itemset is the percentage of total transactions in which that itemset was bought. A support of 0.01 for a given itemset means that that itemset was bought in 1% of all transactions. We also need to establish the minimum itemset length to 2 using lambda functions."
